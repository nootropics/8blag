8blag
=====

Perhaps a background for my blag in 8 bits. Maybe more. Maybe it'll disappear. Who knows?

The color palette is mainly based around the [NES color palette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#NES), so it doesn't look like some colorblind developer made it (anymore).
Of course, I will tweak some colors here and there if they seem a bit bland, but you know.
